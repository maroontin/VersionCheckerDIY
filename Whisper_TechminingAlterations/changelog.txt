4.1.0
Updated and tested against StarSector 0.98a-RC8

Testing included:
* Multiple colonies (from size 3-7)
* Multiple TechMining buildings
* Using Story Points
* Removing a TechMining building
* Removing a TechMining building which had been improved with Story Points
* Shifting the destination of TechMining finds

And a whole bunch of testing the various options. I hammered it pretty thoroughly, to the point of having way more stuff (including Special Items) than I know what to do with.

Some of the code was simplified, more settings made available, the settings toned down considerably by default. See the User Configurable section for details, the earlier version is kept as a reference for those who want to ramp it up to eleven.

3.0.0
Updated and tested against StarSector 0.97a-RC11

Fixed an issue where the mod would occasionally give the player a Special colony item, after the player had decivilized a planet and re-colonized it for his own use. This was not meant to happen.

2.0.0
* The value of the drops has been reduced in the "settings.json" file below:
  # the base credit value of ordinary drops (multiplied by ruins size and colony size)
  "wta_ruinsvalue_basic" : 4000, <<< was 5000
  "wta_ruinsvalue_goods" : 3000, <<< was 4000
  "wta_ruinsvalue_other" : 2000, <<< was 3000

* Blueprints and modspecs can be found *even if the character already knows them*. I realized that just because a character knows a blueprint or modspec, doesn't mean that it cannot be found again when doing a deep-dive into the ruins - the concept of there being only one ever in the entire sector makes no sense. Now you can find duplicates - happy selling!

* Sometimes you just don't have an Alpha AI core to throw onto your techmining structure. Never fear, Beta and Gamma AI cores will work also - though not as well as an Alpha AI core, of course:
  * Alpha AI Core - 25% bonus
  * Beta AI Core - 15% bonus
  * Gamma AI Core - 5% bonus

* The bonuses given by an Alpha/Beta/Gamma AI core can be configured in the "settings.json" file below:
  # the Tech-mining finds bonuses for Alpha, Beta and Gamma cores
  "wta_alphacore_finds_bonus": 0.25f,
  "wta_betacore_finds_bonus": 0.15f,
  "wta_gammacore_finds_bonus": 0.05f,

* The finds increase bonuses given by Beta/Gamma AI cores will be displayed correctly in the TechMining structure's tooltip.
